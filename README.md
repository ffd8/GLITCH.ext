### *what is this?!*  
GLITCH.EXT is a browser extension to glitch websites across the web!  
This extension builds upon the same named net.art intervention at [hek.ch](https://hek.ch),  
for their [Net Works, 09.03 – 13.04.21](https://www.hek.ch/en/program/events-en/event/hek-net-works-ted-davis-glitchext.html). 

-----
### *what is happening?!*  
This injects 3 libraries ([p5.js](https://p5js.org/), [p5.glitch](https://p5.glitch.me/), [html2canvas](http://html2canvas.hertzen.com/)) + [custom code](glitch_ext_chrome/) into websites while browsing,  
enabling you to glitch ANY\* element on ANY\* website... *\*almost*
 
-----
### *how do i get it?!*  
##### Manually
I suggest this technique, so you can inspect the code and know what you're installing.  

- download [latest release](https://github.com/ffd8/GLITCH.ext/releases/latest) or clone repo  
- visit [chrome://extensions](chrome://extensions)
- activate 'Developer mode' *(upper right)*
- click 'Load unpacked'
- select the **/glitch\_ext\_chrome** directory
- select extensions icon (upper right) and pin GLITCH.ext
- enjoy glitching the web! 

##### Webstore
This technique is nice and easy, but you have to trust me (which you can.. but shouldn't).

- visit [GLITCH.ext](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/glitchext/ngngpnbcdhonkblmjkognhhdmhkjjhaf?hl=en) in the Chrome Webstore
- click 'Add to Chrome' 
- select extensions icon (upper right) and pin GLITCH.ext
- enjoy glitching the web!

### *what do i do?!*  
Once installed, you'll find the following options in its popup:  

| Menu        |   Info  |

### *hoow do i fix it?!*  
Glitches to page are only temporary. 
Simply refresh it to return things to *normal*.

-----
### *why does this exist?!*
Because.

### *can you elaborate?!*
> As culture transitioned from physical to virtual during the past Covid-19 year, GLITCH.ext pays homage to glitch in both the analogue and digital domain: Firstly, to HeK's own glitch façade, [H3333333K](https://wwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww.bitnik.org/h3333333k/) (2015) by [!Mediengruppe Bitnik](https://wwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww.bitnik.org/), an architecturally implemented JPEG-glitch. Secondly, glitching websites incites [Glitch Browser](https://web.archive.org/web/20100104085912/http://glitchbrowser.com/) (2005) by [Dimitre Lima (DMTR)](http://dmtr.org/), [Ant Scott (BEFLIX)](http://beflix.com/) and [Iman Moradi](http://www.organised.info/), which JPEG-glitched all images of a given website via proxy server. During my master studies here in Basel (2007-2009), resulting in a thesis focused on glitching the JPEG file format, [Precise Mishandling of the Digital Image Structure](https://www.teddavis.org/includes/papers/teddavis_precise_mishandling_duxu_04.pdf), virtual exchange with the artists behind Glitch Browser and local video-sniffing workshops by !Mediengruppe Bitnik helped shape my developing practice. They joined a growing exposure to notions of revealing the invisible, exploiting digital media below the surface, and networked art. Starting with [TEXT2IMAGE](https://www.teddavis.org/text2image/) + [HEADer_REMIX](http://ffd8.org/header_remix/) (2009), throughout the past 10+ years, glitch continues to find its way into my work, with its endless stream of surprising images and unique artefacts to discover.
